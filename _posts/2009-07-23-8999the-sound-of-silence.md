Hello darkness, my old friend  
I've come to talk with you again  
Because a vision softly creeping  
Left its seeds while I was sleeping  
And the vision that was planted  
In my brain still remains  
Within the sound of silence  
  
In restless dreams, I walked alone  
  
Narrow streets of cobblestone  
'Neath the halo of a street lamp  
I turned my collar to the cold and damp  
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash  
Of a neon light that split the night  
And touched the sound of silence  
  
And in the naked light I saw  
Ten thousand people, maybe more  
  
People talking without speaking  
People hearing without listening  
People writing songs that voices  
Never share and no one dared  
Disturb the sound of silence  
  
"Fools", said I, "You do not know  
Silence like a cancer grows  
Hear my words that I might teach you  
  
Take my arms that I might reach you  
But my words, like silent raindrops fell  
And echoed in the wells of silence  
  
And the people bowed and prayed  
To the neon god they made  
And the sign flashed out its warning  
In the words that it was forming  
And the sign said the words of the prophets are written  
  
On the subway walls and tenement halls  
And whispered in the sounds of silence
