> A free man at the start of a long journey... whose conclusion is uncertain...

  
  

> Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free. A strong man can save himself, a great man can save another.

  
  

> I guess it comes down to a simple choice: get busy living or get busy dying.

  
  

> Hope is a good thing,maybe the best of things,and no good thing ever dies.

  
  

> Forget that there are … place … in the world that are not made out of stone, there is something … inside … that they can not get to … that is hope.
