hey lady,you lady   
cursin' at your life   
you're a discontened mother   
and a regimented wife   
i've no doubt you dream about   
the thinds you'll never do   
but i wish someone had to talked to me   
like i wanna talk to you   
i've been to georgia and california   
and anywhere i could run   
took the head of a preacher man   
and we made love in the sun   
but i ran out of places and friendly faces   
because i had to be free   
i've been to paradise   
but i've never been to me   
please lady,please lady   
don't just walk away   
'cause i have this need to tell you   
why i'm alone today   
ican see so much of me   
still living in your eyes   
won't you share a part of a weary heart   
that has lived million lies   
oh i've been to nice and the isle of greece   
while i sipped champagne on a yacht   
i moved like harlot in monte carlo   
and showed'em what i've got   
i've been undressed by kings   
and i've seen some things   
that a woman ain't supposed to see,   
hey lady i've been to paradise   
but i 've never been to me   
   
sometimes i've been to cryin'   
for unborn children   
that might have made me complete   
but i,i took the sweet life   
and never knew   
i'd bitter from the sweet   
i spent my life exploring the subtle whoring   
that cost too much to be free hey lady,   
i've been to paradise (i've been to paradise)   
i've been to paradise   
but i've never been to me
