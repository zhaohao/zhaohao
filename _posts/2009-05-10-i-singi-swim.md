When the birds are sleeping,that's when the trees sing.  
You left your winter clothes,and your teeth marks in my skin.  
  
So shake the leaves, off the trees,watch them float down the stream.  
Your son, your daughter,swimming in the water.  
  
And I miss you, even when you're around,I'm a black cloud,sending lightning to the ground.  
  
So darling please, show your teeth,just one more dance to help me sleep.  
Whirl, cold water eyes,fill the past with friendly nights.  
Human skin, can be hard to live in,you'll feel better in the morning.  
Wash your hands in the lake,you've got a heart, some way~  
  
Trails lost in the snow,make way for winter's eerie glow,and that black rock in your bedroom.  
  
I hope you'll climb it soon,in your boat, tied to a tree,I hope you'll find the sea.  
  
Throw me a dream please, it's been a dreamless sleep,for such a long time, such a long time~  
  
Sing myself awake,watch the branches break,no one could ever take your place.  
  
Wash your face in the lake,you've got a diamond under your skin.
