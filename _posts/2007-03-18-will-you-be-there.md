Michael Jackson －Will You Be There  
  
Hold me , Like the River Jordan  
And I will then say to thee  , You are my friend  
  
Carry me Like you are my brother  
Love me like a mother ,  Will you be there  
  
Weary  
Tell me ,  will you hold me  
When wrong will you scold me  
When lost will you find me  
  
But they told me  
A man should be faithfull  
And walk when not able  
And fight 'til the end  
But I'm only human  
  
Everyone's taking control of me  
Seems that the world's  
Got a role for me  
I'm so confused  
Will you show to me  
You'll be there for me  
And care enough to bear me  
  
…………  
  
Spoken:  
In our darkest hour  
In my deepest despair  
Will you still care  
Will you be there  
In my trials  
And my tribulations  
  
Through our doubts  
And frustrations  
In my violence  
In my turbulence  
Through my fear  
And my confessions  
In my anguish and my pain  
Through my joy and my sorrow  
  
In the promise Of another tomorrow  
I'll never let you part  
For you're always in my heart
