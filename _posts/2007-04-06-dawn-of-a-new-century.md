Secret Garden   
   
Imagine. Our planet floating silently in space.    
Around it, a white dove flies, forever circling.    
Every one hundred years, the dove's wing gently touches the face of the earth.    
The time it would take for the feathered wing to wear this planet down to nothing is eternity.   
   
Within eternity time passes.    
Within time, there is change.    
Soon the wing of the white dove will touch our world again.    
The dawn of a new century.    
Time for a new beginning.   
   
Now is eternity   
At the break of dawn of a century   
A thousand years of joy and tears   
We leave behind   
Love is our destiny   
Celebrate the dawn of a century   
Let voices ring, rejoice and sing   
Now is the time   
   
Love is eternity    
Dawn of a century   
Now is our destiny   
Dawn of a century   
Dawn of a century
