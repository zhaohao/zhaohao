Secret Garden  
  
Imagine. Our planet floating silently in space.  
Around it, a white dove flies, forever circling.  
Every one hundred years, the dove's wing gently touches the face of the earth.  
The time it would take for the feathered wing to wear this planet down to nothing is eternity.  
  
Within eternity time passes.  
Within time, there is change.  
Soon the wing of the white dove will touch our world again.  
The dawn of a new century.  
Time for a new beginning.  
  
Now is eternity  
At the break of dawn of a century  
A thousand years of joy and tears  
We leave behind  
Love is our destiny  
Celebrate the dawn of a century  
Let voices ring, rejoice and sing  
Now is the time  
  
Love is eternity  
Dawn of a century  
Now is our destiny  
Dawn of a century  
Dawn of a century
