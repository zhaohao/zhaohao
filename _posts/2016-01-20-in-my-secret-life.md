I saw you this morning  
You were moving so fast  
Can't seem to loosen my grip  
On the past  
And I miss you so much  
Theres no one in sight  
And were still making love  
In My Secret Life  
I smile when I'm angry  
I cheat and I lie  
I do what I have to do  
To get by  
But I know what is wrong  
And I know what is right  
And I'd die for the truth  
In My Secret Life  
Hold on, hold on, my brother  
My sister, hold on tight  
I finally got my orders  
I'll be marching through the morning  
Marching through the night  
Moving cross the borders  
Of My Secret Life  
Looked through the paper  
Makes you want to cry  
Nobody cares if the people  
Live or die  
And the dealer wants you thinking  
That its either black or white  
Thank God its not that simple  
In My Secret Life
