In any walk of life, if you want other people to take notice of you, you can only do it by relying on solid achievements and sound abililty.  
  
If there is only one thing in the world that stirs your emotions, let that  
be sincerity. If there is only one way in the world that will enable you to  
achieve success, let that be diligence.
