hey lady,you lady  
cursin' at your life  
you're a discontened mother  
and a regimented wife  
i've no doubt you dream about  
the thinds you'll never do  
but i wish someone had to talked to me  
like i wanna talk to you  
i've been to georgia and california  
and anywhere i could run  
took the head of a preacher man  
and we made love in the sun  
but i ran out of places and friendly faces  
because i had to be free  
i've been to paradise  
but i've never been to me  
please lady,please lady  
don't just walk away  
'cause i have this need to tell you  
why i'm alone today  
ican see so much of me  
still living in your eyes  
won't you share a part of a weary heart  
that has lived million lies  
oh i've been to nice and the isle of greece  
while i sipped champagne on a yacht  
i moved like harlot in monte carlo  
and showed'em what i've got  
i've been undressed by kings  
and i've seen some things  
that a woman ain't supposed to see,  
hey lady i've been to paradise  
but i 've never been to me  
  
sometimes i've been to cryin'  
for unborn children  
that might have made me complete  
but i,i took the sweet life  
and never knew  
i'd bitter from the sweet  
i spent my life exploring the subtle whoring  
that cost too much to be free hey lady,  
i've been to paradise (i've been to paradise)  
i've been to paradise  
but i've never been to me
