i stand alone in the darkness the winter of my life come so fast  
  
memories go back to childhood to days i still recall  
  
oh how happy i was then there was no sorrow there was no pain  
  
walking through the green field sunshine in my eyes  
  
i am still there everywhere i am the dust in the wind i am the star in the  
northern sky  
  
i never stay anywhere i am the wind in the trees would you wait for me  
forever
